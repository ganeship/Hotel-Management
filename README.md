## About The Project


We modeled our hotel booking website after onefinestay.com, taking inspiration in design and features while adding some extra functionality like Payment Gateway and Google Sign-in. 
 Key Features include:
  - Users can log in normally(done via JWT Tokens) or can log in through Google Sign-in.
  - Users have a wide array of options via filters using which they can customize the hotels shown to them.
  - Users can see the location of a hotel(done via Google Maps Integration).
  - Users will be recommended Similar Hotels based on Price and Location.
  - Users will be able to know on which Dates a particular hotel is booked/unavailable. 
  - Users will be able to pay for their booking and get a confirmation mail for the same.
